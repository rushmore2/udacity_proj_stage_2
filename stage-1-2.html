                            The Basic HTML vocabulary consists of <b>Tags</b>, <b>Elements</b> and <b>Attributes</b>. Most <b>Tags</b> have an opening and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag. An HTML <b>element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. The <b> Attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element. This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444"> video</a> will show you the structure of the HTML <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em> as well as to make links using <em>attributes</em>.

                            HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements create an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. <em>a, span, br, tag</em> and <em>strong</em> are all <b>inline</b> elements while <em>div, p</em> and <em>form</em> are<b> block</b> elements.

                            A "tree-like" structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the <b>hierarchical</b> nature of a <b>structure</b> in a graphical form. It is named a <em>"tree structure"</em> because the classic <b>representation</b> resembles a <b>tree</b>, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

                            A text editor is a computer program that allows you to create and edit files that contain plain text. This is very different than a robust word processing program like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, because they add special formatting that's hidden to the user. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Text editors are commonly used by web designers and developers because it provides maximum flexibility to create just about anything. This is where professionals "hand code" HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other languages. Text editors like Scratchpad.io and Codepen.io are great tools and best for small projects. But as your web page gets bigger, a program that you can keep on your computer like Sublime Text is recommended.

                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a <em>style sheet language</em> used for describing the <em>look</em> and <em>formatting</em> of a document written in a <em>markup language</em>.

                        <p>
                            <b>Cascading</b> means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

                            Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited.

                            Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.

                        <p>
                            One way to avoid repetition is by usng the HTML <em>class</em> attribute in <em>div</em> tag. The <em>class</em> attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements then style them together in CSS.

                           In order to learn about computer programming, we have to learn new languange. Python has a grammar - the way we're writing grammar in Python is called <em>"notation"</em>. <b>BNF</b> <em>(Backus-Naur Form)</em> is one of the notation techniques for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing.

                            Variables give programmers a way to give names to values. If my_variable is a variable with a value of 2, then the following code would print out 4:

                        <p class="tab">

                        <p>
                           We can even change the value of a variable by re-assigning it to a different value later.

                        What is a function (or "<em>procedures</em>")?

                        <p>
                            A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named square might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        What is the difference between making and using a function?
                    </div>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>
                           Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword def and then giving a function name followed by the function parameters in parentheses. The line must end with a <em>: colon</em>. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the <em>"body"</em> of the function, we write the code that specifies what to do with the input parameters. Every line in the function must be indented. And If you want your function to produce output, it must end with a return statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, the following code could be the definition of a function called square:
                            <p class="tab">
                                <em>def square(x):</em>
                                <br><em>answer = x * x</em>
                                <br><em>return answer</em>
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:
                            <p class="tab">
                                <em>print square(4)</em>
                                <br><em>>>>>16</em>
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.

                          The <em>return</em> keyword tells Python exactly what the function should produce as output. If a function doesn't have a return statement, then you'll get behavior like this:

                          The general Python syntax for a simple if statement is:
                            <p class="tab">
                            <em><b>if</b> condition :</em>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the condition is true, then do the indented statements. If the condition is not true, then skip the indented statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em><b>While</b></em> loops, like the <em>ForLoop</em>, are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a <em>for</em> loop, the <em>while</em> loop will not run <em>n</em> times, but until a defined condition is met.

                            <br>If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until it does what you want.
